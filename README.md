# Univariate-Linear-Regression-on-Fitness-Data
Python script for performing univariate linear regression on fitness data. It reads a CSV file, calculates polynomial features, fits a linear model, and computes regression metrics like R-squared, SSE, MSE, RMSE, and MAE. The results are then documented in a Word file using the python-docx library.
